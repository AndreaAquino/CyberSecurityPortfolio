## Security Policies and Procedures - Cyberportfolio

Welcome to the **Security Policies and Procedures** section of my Cyberportfolio. 
This folder contains a collection of security policy documents, procedural guidelines, and related materials organized by real-world-inspired case scenarios.

### Overview

This subfolder is designed to showcase my ability to develop, analyze, and apply cybersecurity policies and procedures in various practical contexts. 
Each case scenario highlights a specific security challenge or environment, along with tailored policy documents and procedural steps.
Since there were Reports created as part of a teamwork and every part was reviewed by every team member, I highlighted the specific jobs I was responsable for

### Information Security Report Summary

This Information Security Report provides a comprehensive framework for securing the hospital’s information assets, covering policies, procedures, and control mechanisms aligned with international standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, and regulatory requirements including HIPAA and the Australian Privacy Act. The report addresses various aspects of information security from governance to technical controls, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive healthcare data. 
I was specifically responsible for developing and implementing **Section 5.6 – Network Communications Security** and **Section 5.7 – Information Security Incident Management**, which are critical components in safeguarding the backbone digital infrastructure and ensuring an effective response to security incidents.

### Case Scenario 1: Healthcare Organisation – A Hospital

#### 5.6 Network Communications Security

The hospital’s network infrastructure is critical for supporting clinical systems, telemedicine, patient record access, and healthcare collaboration networks. Given the network’s role as the backbone of healthcare operations, the security policies emphasize:

- **Audience:** Applies to all staff including healthcare professionals, management, temporary staff, and contractors.
- **Purpose:** To secure the hospital’s network infrastructure against cyber threats, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
- **Scope:** Encompasses network architecture, access controls, encryption, monitoring, and regulatory compliance.
- **Key Controls & Procedures:**  
  - **Network Segmentation:** Dividing the network into VLANs for enhanced security and performance.  
  - **Data Encryption:** Mandatory use of TLS, SSL, and AES encryption for all in-transit sensitive data.  
  - **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Enforcing least privilege and role-based access controls on network devices.  
  - **Multi-factor Authentication:** Required for accessing critical network infrastructure components.  
  - **Firewall Configuration:** Default-deny inbound/outbound policies with strict rule management to control traffic flow.  
  - **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Signature and behavior-based detection to identify and respond to threats.  
  - **Email Security:** Implementation of secure email gateways, encryption, and authentication mechanisms (SPF, DKIM, DMARC).  
  - **Audit & Review:** Regular internal and external audits to ensure ongoing compliance and security posture.

#### 5.7 Information Security Incident Management

The policy framework defines clear processes to detect, report, assess, and respond to security incidents, supporting the hospital’s resilience and regulatory compliance:

- **Incident Classification:** Critical, Major, and Minor, based on impact on patient safety, operations, and data security.
- **Reporting Procedures:** Mandatory reporting by all personnel to the Incident Response Team (IRT) or IT Security.
- **Response Actions:** Incident assessment, escalation, containment (e.g., network isolation, account disablement), mitigation, investigation, and recovery.
- **Communication:** Timely updates to stakeholders, regulatory notification as required, and post-incident reviews to improve defenses.
- **Culture of Security:** Encourages staff awareness, training, and adherence to policies to foster proactive security readiness.
