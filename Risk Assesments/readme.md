# 🔐 Cybersecurity Risk Assessments

Welcome to the **Risk Assessments** section of my Cybersecurity Portfolio.  
Here, I present hands-on risk evaluation exercises inspired by real-world cyber threats, applying structured methodologies and governance principles across critical sectors.

Each assessment includes:
- A completed risk assessment spreadsheet (.xls)
- A clear scenario description and defined scope
- A visual or embedded risk matrix
- Proposed control recommendations aligned with industry-recognized information security frameworks.

## 📁 Assessment Scenarios

###  1. Tech Company Client – APT34 Risk Assessment  
**Case Study:** DATACOM | The Forage Simulation

As part of a simulated consultancy engagement with **Datacom**, I completed a comprehensive risk assessment following a targeted attack by **APT34**, a state-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat group. I assumed the role of a cybersecurity consultant tasked with identifying risk exposures and advising on mitigation strategies after the compromise of a major tech client's internal systems.

The attack led to the **exfiltration of sensitive customer data and intellectual property**, prompting an urgent review of the client’s internal security posture.

####  1.1. Scenario

  In this simulation, I analyzed a breach attributed to APT34 and performed a structured risk assessment focused on:
  
  - Identifying **vulnerable assets** within the internal network (specifically: a **SQL Database** and a **Cloud Storage Service**)  
  - Mapping **entry points** exploited via spear-phishing and lateral movement  
  - Evaluating **gaps in existing controls** across technical and organizational layers
  
  While the client had basic physical security (e.g. perimeter fence, padlocked entry), they lacked a formal internal cybersecurity risk management strategy.

#### 1.2. Scope

  This assessment focused on the following **critical assets**:
  - **SQL Database**: Housing sensitive operational and customer data  
  - **Cloud Storage Service**: Used for business document storage and backups
  
  Both assets were evaluated in terms of exposure, likelihood of compromise, and potential impact, considering attacker TTPs mapped to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.

#### 1.3. Risk Matrix

A Likelihood × Consequence model was used to score each scenario both **before** and **after** the implementation of control recommendations.

#### 1.4 Frameworks & Tools Used

- **NIST SP 800-30** – Risk Assessment Process  
- **ISO/IEC 27005** – Risk management guidelines  
- **Essential Eight** – Mitigation baseline  
- **MITRE ATT&CK** – Threat modeling reference

#### 1.5. Deliverables

- 📄 [Risk Assessment Spreadsheet (.xlsx)](./Risk%20Assessment%20DataCom-Case%20Study.xlsx)  
  Includes:
  - Defined threat scenarios
  - Likelihood and impact ratings
  - Existing vs. additional control evaluations
  - Residual risk levels

#### 1.6. Highlights

- Applied threat intelligence on APT34 to real-world enterprise context  
- Mapped attacker TTPs using MITRE ATT&CK  
- Designed a structured and auditable risk matrix  
- Aligned control recommendations with industry frameworks  
- Delivered a traceable and actionable assessment report
